# What is this ?
This is all of my NSI courses in 1er and in Terminal in the Thierry Maulnier high school of Nice.    

# How to revise for the BAC ?
I made a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16soBFls3v38-JnBu0KADgJxnjrzJzHGyr81U1swPLLY/edit?usp=sharing) summarizing and containing all the courses and chapters for the BAC.
