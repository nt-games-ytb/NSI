	<h1>Design Mode</h1>

	<h2>Construct a Computer Network </h2>
      <p> Use the mouse to drag and drop the components from the left panel to the
        whiteboard.
		<center><img src="hilfe/gfx/draganddrop.gif"></center>	</p>
	  <p> Use the context menu of the component to delete the icon (Linux and Windows: press
	    right mouse button over the component).
      <p> Connect stations by selecting the cable icon (using the mouse or shortcut ALT+1) and then press the mouse
        button on two components.

      <p> Use the context menu of the component to delete all connections to this station. </p>

	<h2>Configure Components </h2>
      <p> Select the component with a double-click to configure its properties on the
        lower panel of the window which will be opened. Select any name for the component.
        This property does not influence the functionality of the network simulation. </p>

      <p><b>Host/Notebook</b>: Besides the manual configuration of IP properties it is possible
        that the IP configuration is provided by a DHCP server. In order to use this
        functionality one of the hosts within the local computer network must provide
        the DHCP server.</p>

      <p> <b>Router</b>: The Router provides several Network Interface Controller (NIC). This
        NICs must be manually configured. Furthermore IP forwarding is configured by the default
        gateway and the forwarding table. And it is possible to activate and configure a
        firewall. The configuration of the firewall can be processed additionally when the
        simulation mode is selected using a web-interface. </p>

      <p> <b>Switch</b>: The switch is used to connect components within a local computer
        network. This component does not require any configuration. </p>

      <p> <b>Modem</b>: The modem is used to connect virtual networks built within Filius
        which are located at two different real machines. For this purpose it is necessary to
        configure the modem at one machine to wait for incoming connetion requests. The modem
        located at the second machine must initialize the connection and therefore the real
        IP address of the first machine must be configured. </p>

    <h2>Programming Individual Software Components </h2>
      <p> The software assistant provides a simple interface to programme and modify
        individual software components which can be used in the simulation mode. The
        assistant is started using the icon at the upper panel of the window.

    <h2>Switch Application Mode </h2>

      <p>In order to use the previously built computer network it is necessary to switch
        to the simulation mode. The button is located at the upper panel of the window.
